				<h1>Dear Stockholders:</h1>

				<p class="lede">In 2013, Boston Scientific continued
our legacy of delivering meaningful
innovation and executed on key financial
and strategic goals. We are pleased with
our performance and believe that we
are well positioned to accelerate our
growth and increase stockholder value.</p>

				<p>In 2013, we delivered on our full year revenue and
adjusted earnings growth goals and executed against
our five strategic imperatives that include growing
market share, expanding into high-growth adjacencies
and global markets, driving margin improvements and
developing talent and capabilities to lead in a dynamic
global healthcare market. We believe that this
execution helped to drive value for our stockholders.</p>

				<p>In 2013, we realized consolidated revenue of $7.143
billion. This represents a two percent increase in
operational revenue and a one percent revenue
decline on a reported basis<sup>3</sup>. We delivered full-year
adjusted earnings per share of $0.73<sup>4</sup>. We improved
gross profit margin to 69.6 percent from 67.6 percent
in 2012&#8212;driven primarily from our standard cost
reductions and process improvements. We continued
to invest in meaningful innovation. Our Research &amp;
Development (R&amp;D) expense was $861 million in
2013 or 12 percent of sales. We continued to pursue
efficiencies in our R&amp;D approach by leveraging
innovation across the company. We deployed a
balanced capital allocation strategy, which included
repurchasing approximately $500 million of our
common stock.</p>

				<p>To improve our global effectiveness, we reorganized
our business units in 2013 to operate and measure
them from a global perspective along three reporting
segments: MedSurg, which consists of our Neuromodulation,
Endoscopy, and Urology and Women's
Health businesses; Rhythm Management, which
consists of our Cardiac Rhythm Management and
Electrophysiology businesses; and Cardiovascular,
which consists of our Interventional Cardiology and
Peripheral Interventions businesses.</p>
				<p>For 2013, the MedSurg segment grew revenue at
nine percent on a constant currency basis and faster
than its underlying markets, with each business
performing well&#8212;led by growth of 24 percent in Neuromodulation, seven percent in Endoscopy, and
three percent in Urology and Women's Health<sup>5</sup>. The
Rhythm Management segment showed encouraging
results with improved revenue in 2013. The sales within
our Cardiovascular segment were down three percent
on a constant currency basis in 2013, primarily due
to softness in our sales of coronary drug-eluting
stents (DES) offset, in part, by continued strength in
our other cardiology products, such as guide wires
and atherectomy devices<sup>5</sup>.</p>
				<h2>Performance that Counts</h2>
				<p>We estimate that we grew faster than or at the
market growth rate in five of seven of our businesses
in 2013. Highlights of our 2013 performance:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We continued to strengthen our market position in 
					Neuromodulation, particularly in the U.S. where we estimate 
					that the Precision Spectra<sup>TM</sup> Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) 
					System took significant market share and accelerated 
					overall market growth.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>In Endoscopy, our solid sales growth was driven
primarily by our hemostasis franchise, biliary devices
and metal stents. Our Alair<sup>&reg;</sup> Bronchial Thermoplasty
System, an innovative medical device for the
treatment of severe asthma, delivered double-digit
sales growth as we surpassed 350 treatment sites
worldwide. Our Endoscopy business experienced
strong international sales in 2013 as well, driven
by expansion of our commercial capabilities,
the registration of existing products, as well as
continued investments in new products.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>In our Urology and Women's Health business, sales
in 2013 were driven by our global expansion and
several new product launches. International sales
strength in 2013 stemmed from registration of
new products and a shift to a direct sales model
in several European countries.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>Within our Cardiac Rhythm Management business,
we estimate that we exited the year with sequential
worldwide market share gains. Our pacemaker
franchise continued to see strong adoption of our
INGENIO<sup>&reg;</sup> family of pacemaker systems. And
in our defibrillation franchise there was broad
physician interest in our S-ICD<sup>&reg;</sup> System, the only
subcutaneous implantable defibrillator available
for the treatment of at-risk sudden cardiac
death patients.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>The acquisition of C.R. Bard Inc.'s electrophysiology
business enhanced our overall electrophysiology
(EP) business by differentiating and expanding
our commercial presence and product portfolio,
including catheter and recording device technologies
that will enable us to better serve the rapidly
growing global EP market.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>Excluding DES, our Interventional Cardiology
business delivered solid constant currency sales
growth as we continued to offer physicians the
broadest array of tools to treat the most complex
lesions, from imaging catheters to atherectomy to
devices designed to treat chronic total occlusions<sup>5</sup>.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>Peripheral Interventions demonstrated strong,
consistent performance in 2013 by delivering
above market constant currency growth, driven
by our leading balloon and stent franchises<sup>5</sup>.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Innovation that Matters</h2>
				<p>Boston Scientific's meaningful innovations are
aimed at fueling our growth and meeting patient
needs around the world. As the market shift toward
value-based healthcare continues, customers,
payers and patients are increasingly expecting
solutions that deliver improvements in both clinical
and economic outcomes. We see opportunities to
meet the evolving needs of our changing market,
to drive more value from our pipeline and to offer
solutions that can ultimately transform the lives of
more patients while enhancing overall value to the
healthcare system.</p>
				<p>We believe that our portfolio and pipeline are highly
differentiated to meet both unique clinical value
to patients and economic value to our customers.
Key highlights in 2013:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Our S-ICD<sup>&reg;</sup> System won the prestigious 2013 Prix Galien 
					USA Award for Best Medical Technology. This breakthrough 
					technology is meaningful because it offers patients an 
					alternative solution to transvenous ICDs, which require 
					leads to be placed in the heart itself. We remain excited 
					about this highly differentiated therapy and its unique 
					ability to provide protection from sudden cardiac death 
					without touching the heart.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>Our Alair<sup>&reg;</sup> Bronchial Thermoplasty System was
recognized as a finalist of the 2013 Prix Galien
USA Award. For patients with drug-resistant
asthma, this system helps to reduce asthma
attack frequency and severity while potentially
decreasing costly visits to the emergency room.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>We gained a favorable FDA Advisory Panel vote
(13 to 1) for our WATCHMAN<sup>&reg;</sup> Left Atrial Appendage
Closure Device<sup>6</sup>. This unique device is designed to
close the left atrial appendage and prevent blood
clot migration in atrial fibrillation patients, reducing
the incidence of stroke and systemic embolism.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>We achieved CE Mark and FDA 510(k) clearance for
our novel Rhythmia<sup>TM</sup> Mapping System designed
to enhance treatment options and simplify
complicated electrophysiology procedures.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>We received CE Mark approval for our Lotus<sup>TM</sup> Valve
System<sup>6</sup>, a next-generation transcatheter aortic
valve replacement (TAVR) device that offers precise
positioning and placement, with an outer skirt
designed to limit paravalvular leak, a key determinant
of long-term mortality.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>We enhanced our DES portfolio and capabilities
with FDA approval and U.S. launch of our Promus
PREMIER<sup>TM</sup> Coronary Stent System. This next-generation
system offers physicians improved
performance in treating patients with coronary
artery disease. Internationally, our SYNERGY<sup>TM</sup>
Coronary Stent System<sup>6</sup>, a premium drug-eluting
stent technology that features a bioabsorbable drug
and polymer platform, continued to perform well.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>We strengthened our market position in the U.S.
in 2013 with the Precision Spectra<sup>TM</sup> device, the
world's first and only SCS system with Illumina
3D<sup>TM</sup> Software and 32 contacts designed to provide
chronic pain relief, with more coverage, flexibility
and advanced control to a wider range of patients.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>We generated momentum with the Vessix<sup>TM</sup>
Renal Denervation System<sup>6</sup>, currently available in
Europe, the Middle East, Australia, New Zealand
and select markets in Asia. The Vessix System
is a second-generation balloon-expandable,
multipoint renal denervation platform that uses
bipolar energy to disrupt the hyperactivity of renal
sympathetic nerves that leads to uncontrolled
high blood pressure.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Global Expansion</h2>
				<p>Expanding our global capabilities remains a strategic
imperative to drive our growth. Our investments
in the emerging markets are beginning to payoff.
In 2013, our sales in Brazil, Russia, India and China
(BRIC) grew on a constant currency basis by nearly
30 percent and in our total emerging markets by
20 percent<sup>5</sup>. We believe that our realignment along
global divisions has led to improved overall company
performance, giving us the ability to better coordinate
global product launches, balance our product
portfolios and commercial resources and align
investments in R&amp;D with what we believe to be
the high-return opportunities.</p>
				<p>In 2013, we opened the Boston Scientific Institute
for Advancing Science and the Innovation Center in
Shanghai, China, and established an office for the
first time in Russia. We believe these developments
strengthen our ability to work closely with more
customers around the world and bring new treatment
options to the patients they serve.</p>
				<h2>Advancing Science for Life</h2>
				<p>Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing
our strategic imperatives and expect to continue
to improve our financial performance, expand our
operating margin and accelerate full-year operational
revenue and adjusted earnings growth. Our goal is
to grow our core businesses faster than the market
and to grow our adjusted operating income faster
than sales. Along with a focus on enhanced
profitability, we expect to continue to generate
strong cash flow to support investments aligned
with our strategic priorities.</p>
				<p>Beyond our business performance, Boston Scientific
continues to embrace its role as a good corporate
citizen in the communities where we live and work.
Whether it is through sustainable business practices
or a day of regional volunteering, we are investing
time, talent and resources to bring support and
services to these communities. On the sidebar
to the right are a few examples of our efforts to
transform lives in our communities.</p>
				<p>Our organization is driven to develop meaningful
innovation and to collaborate with our customers
to advance science with the ultimate objective of
transforming lives. Our employees are fulfilling that
mission every day by helping patients, customers
and the communities where our employees live
and work.</p>
				<p>We thank our stockholders for their continued support
of Boston Scientific. We thank our employees for their
dedication, winning spirit and high performance. And
we look forward to reporting on our future progress.</p>
				<p>Sincerely,</p>

				<p><strong>Pete Nicholas</strong><br>Chairman of the Board</p>
